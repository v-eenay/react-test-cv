    "bio": "Hey there, I'm Vinay Koirala, currently juggling the role of IT Lecturer at Itahari International College. Armed with a degree in Computer Science Engineering and an MBA, I bring a tech-savvy meets business-minded approach to the table. When not wrangling code in the classroom, you'll find me moonlighting as an actor with Kalalaya Itahari or attempting to coax music out of my guitar with mixed success. JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, C, C++, and Python are my go-to tools for navigating the digital realm. This website? Born out of sheer boredom, it's a showcase of the coding symphony I've curated. Feel free to dive in, and let's keep the tech chatter both detailed and amusing!",
    "contactmessage": "If you're as tired of monotony as I am, let's break the boredom together! Whether you have burning questions about tech, want to discuss the latest acting gig, or need a guitar strumming companion (even if it's just virtually), drop me a line. I'm all ears for engaging conversations and exciting collaborations.",
